# codecept-typescript-example

This is a fork of https://github.com/elukoyanov/codecept-typescript-example
demonstrating CodeceptJS with page objects and helpers written in TypeScript.
elukoyanov did the overwhelming majority of work, I only integrated it and got
it running on contemporary versions.

To see it work, run

```sh
$ yarn install && yarn test:e2e
```

I don't know how any of it works so don't ask me for help. However, I'll gladly accept contributions that improve the demonstration; for instance

- update dependency versions;
- show off more features of CodeceptJS in relation to TypeScript;
- reduce obtuse boilerplate.
